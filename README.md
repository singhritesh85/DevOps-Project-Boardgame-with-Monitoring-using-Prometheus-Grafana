This DevOps project aims to create the infrastructure for the project, establish the end-to-end CI/CD setup and its monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana (Prometheus and Grafana used as Monitoring Tool in this project). Jenkins was used as CI/CD Tool. For Code Quality check SonarQube, to keep the Artifacts Nexus and Maven was used as a Build Tool. Trivy was used as a Security Scanning tool, Docker Image was stored in ECR (Elastic Container Registry) and for deployment ArgoCD had been used. The high-level architecture diagram for the project is as shown above.

Prometheus and Grafana had been used as monitoring tool for this project. Node-Exporter will extract the metrics from the Jenkins-Master, Jenkins-Slave, SonarQube-Server, Nexus-Server, Prometheus Server, Blackbox-Exporter Server, Grafana-Server and EKS Cluster and send to the Prometheus Server. The scrap_config section in the configuration file of Prometheus is as shown in the screenshot attached below. I had installed Blackbox Exporter on a different server and not on the Prometheus Server. The module name which is shown in the yellow colour highlight for blackbox exporter must match with the module name of blackbox exporter configuration file (monitor_website.yml) present of the blackbox exporter server at the path (/opt/blackbox_exporter_linux_amd64/monitor_website.yml). Prometheus blackbox operator is used for endpoint monitoring (Synthetic Monitoring) across the protocol http, https, TCP and ICMP. In this project I am monitoring the Application URL https://boardgame.singhritesh85.com with the help of Prometheus Blackbox-Exporter. Prometheus blackbox exporter will send the metrics to Prometheus. For this project Prometheus acts as a DataSource for Grafana and send metrics to Grafana which we can see with the help of Charts and Graphs.
